# Enumerated types - exercises

### Task 1

Crete an **enum**  `Weekday`  with constants  MONDAY, TUESDAY, ... SUNDAY. The
enum should contain  _boolean_ `isWeekDay`  and  _boolean_ `isHoliday` methods.

The  `isHoliday`  method should return the opposite result to the call of the
`isWeekDay`  method. Please implement the  `whichIsGreater`  method as a scope
of the `enum` class.
This method should accept an object of  Weekday type.
This method should display information that the indicated day of the week is the
predecessor or successor of the day of the week passed as the method
argument.

Please consider using the `compareTo` method.
Present the solution described above with an example.
